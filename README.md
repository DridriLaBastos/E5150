# E5150
Emulator of the first IBM PC : the IBM PC 5150 written in C++11. Currently in development.

First try
	Why using this:
 - Lot of debug messages in debug mode
 - It provides PIO access (for exemple bochs doesn't)
 - It tryies to be most accurate as possile when emulating hardware
 - It's a good learning tool for PC architecture, but it is not focused on performances
