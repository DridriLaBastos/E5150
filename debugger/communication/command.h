/**
 * This file contains the C declarations of the functions called from the debugger to send command information and
 * configuration to the emulator.
 *
 * The functions declared in this file are called from the debugger. The return value of the function will dictate
 * the debugger the value to send to the emulator. If the function returns Ã  0, the same value is sent to the debugger.
 * Any other value will be translated to a 1.
 *
 * The command associated to each functions are divided into two groups : pass-command and non-pass command.
 *
 * A non-pass command will block forever the emulation and get back to the debugger cli when the function called to
 * performs its execution ends. The display command is such a command. At the end of the execution of the command, the
 * debugger prompt should be displayed again.
 *
 * A pass command will instruct the emulator to run the simulation for a certain amount of time (or endlessly). After the
 * end of the execution of the function associated to the command, the debugger will let the emulator running.
 * The continue or step commands are such command. When the function associated to the command ends its
 * execution, the emulator should run the amount of time specified and only after ask for the debugger prompt.
 *
 * Functions associated to non-pass command should always return non 0. Functions associated to a pass-command should return
 * non 0 on error and 0 for success.
 *
 * The quit command is a special case : whether the function returns a 0 or not, the emulator will always quit and kill
 * the debugger.
